## ABSTRACT
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have become the state-of-the-art methods for image classification tasks. However, one of the most significant limitations is they require a lot of labeled data. In many applications, collecting this much data is sometimes not feasible. One-Shot Learning aims to solve this problem, so we want to study how to recognize Sinhala, Tamil, and Archaeological letters using one-shot learning with fewer label data. 

One-shot learning is a categorization problem that aims to classify objects given only a limited number of samples, with the ultimate goal of creating a more human-like learning algorithm. Solving the one-shot learning problem by using a special network structure: Siamese Network.

Character recognition using the image processing method is an old trend and this process requires a lot of datasets. The more data we train the more accurate the results will be. most of the time it is hard to get a huge amount of data in a short while.

To overcome this problem, the Oneshot learning method aims to predict the data more accurately than the image processing method, with a few examples. This inspired us to focus on the one-shot learning approach and continue our research.
